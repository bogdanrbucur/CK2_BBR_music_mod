# Crusader Kings II BBR Music mod

This mod adds 42 new medieval tracks on top of the vanilla ones. They are mostly from Medieval II Total War and are ambient European style tracks.

I made this mod for myself years ago and found it really complements the vanilla music.

It is Ironman compatible and should be compatible with any other mods.

All rights to this beautiful music belong to their legal owners, not me. This is just a collection to enhance the game experience.
